# ttt2-item_climb
TTT2 item that makes it possible to climb

This is a massively modified version of https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=113495466.
It's balanced for TTT and the functionallity got limited. With the help of this item, you are able to multi jump (def. 3) faced to walls while being armed with weapons and doing wallruns.

ConVars:
climbswep2_windsound = 1 (CLIENT) (wind sound)
climbswep2_wallrun_minheight = 250 (SHARED)
climbswep2_maxjumps = 3 (SHARED) (maximum amount of multi jumps faced to walls)
climbswep2_showhud = 1 (CLIENT) (Show the climb HUD?)
